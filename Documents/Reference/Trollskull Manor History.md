# History of Trollskull Manor

- Owned by Ulkoria Stonemarrow. She sold the tavern to go adventuring.
- Sold to a family of shield dwarves. They fell on hard times and sold it to a woman named Arissa Mirthkettle.
- Mirthkettle converted the building into an orphanage. She turned out to be a hag who was cooking and eating the children.
- The building was then abandoned for several years, haunted by its horrible reputation.
- A half-elf named Lif took over the building and converted it back into a tavern.
- Lif was killed in a terrible accident 40 years ago when one of the support beams on his ale casks broke and collapsed on top of him.
- A couple named the Morleys bought the property and attempted to reopen it, but the haunting of the property combined with the economic recession which preceded Lord Dagult becoming Open Lord saw them go bankrupt.
- The property changed hands several times, but with no serious efforts to occupy it.
- A small halfling clan named the Curlbottoms bought the property around 1476 DR. They didn’t reopen the tavern, using the property exclusively as a residence for until 1484 DR when they moved to Neverwinter, caughter in Lord Dagult’s dream of rebuilding the city.
- Most recently, Emmek Frewn attempted to purchase the property at public auction, only to be outbid by Volothamp Geddarm (who was interested in researching its “haunted history” for his next book).
