# Tavern Time

## Each night

1. There is a 1 in 1d6 chance that an Event will occur that night.

2. Roll 1d6 to determine the number of significant patrons in the tavern that night, then use the Patron Table to randomly determine which patrons are present. If a result of “Renaer’s Friends” is rolled, roll on the Patrons – Renaer’s Friends table to determine the final result.

3. Look at the Topics/Agendas for the patrons who are present. Generally speaking, you can use one per patron or just select one from among the patrons. When in doubt, default  to the first unused bullet point. Supplement or replace these topics with other major events occurring in your campaign.

## Using Patrons

Note that the significant patrons present on a particular night may all clump together in a single interaction, or they may be separate interactions happening simultaneously or spread out over the course of the evening. Even if various patron interactions do start out separate from each other, don’t be afraid to have them crossover and collide with each other as the events of the evening continue to play out.

Pay attention to which NPCs resonate with the players: Who do they find interesting? Who do they like? Who do they enjoy interacting with? Find ways to keep bringing those characters back. Reincorporate them into other facets of the campaign (and vice versa).

## Using Topics/Agendas

These are conversational gambits, interpersonal developments, or needs that a particular patron has. Think about what reactions the other patrons present in the tavern that night will have to the topic or agenda as it occurs.

You should be able to very quickly reference this material and then rapidly generate a 5-10 minute roleplaying interaction any time the PCs choose to engage with the common room. (In some cases, of course, these interactions will also expand to the players’ level of interest and take more time to fully resolve.)
