# Staffing

## Bartenders

### Lif

If the spirit of Lif can be pacified and befriended, he makes an excellent bartender.

> The “Lif” is a custom drink special with some form of liquor (which varies each night) on the bottom and ale on top. It’s not entirely clear how the ghost is achieving this perfect separation.

### Mosp

 A blue-and-green-scaled kobold. Mosp has a reptilian palette and his drinks don’t always sit quite right in mammalian mouths. If he’s the bartender, however, Trollskull Manor will attract a large reptilian and draconic crowd.

### Lillian Haekin

A Zakharan woman, Lillian has a modest command of liqueurs, but her true mastery is in teas. She will arrange with Fala Lefaliir of Corellon’s Crown to supply the Manor with a dizzying variety of foreign teas.

## Barmaids

### Ryba

Ryba is a wererat and a member of the Shard Shunners (see “Emmek Frewn” below). She tries to get hired as a halfing waitress so that she can work mischief.

### Althaea, Elthaea, Ulthaea

These mysterious star elf triplets float through the air while sitting in a perfect lotus position. Their silver hair stands upright in a halo around their heads. Likely interview questions include:

- Can you walk on your legs? “We have not in a very long time.”
- Can you serve drinks from that position? [They use telekinesis to deliver a drink to the questioner.]
- Why are they interested in working as barmaids in Trollskull Manor? “We have received a divinatory vision that we are needed here. We shall work for you for a period of twelve months. So it is written. Also, tips are important.”

### Patric Nivka

Patric, an Illuskan lad, was kicked out of his parents’ house last week when his parents discovered he was dating a half-elf named Tanya Pav. He needs a job and a place to stay. (Letting him stay in a room upstairs or giving him an advance on his paycheck will help solve the latter problem.)

## Cooks

### Isgrigg & Dupere

Just ordinary humans. They left their last gig because the bar transformed into a tinker gnome hotspot. “And if you’ve ever seen thirty-five tinker gnomes all working on the same project while drunk… well, I like my jobs to be a bit less explosive if you know what I mean.”

### Turgattan Thornhammer

A dwarf chef and former adventurer. He lost his former adventuring companions in the Serpent Hills. He lacks references, but assures the PCs that he handled the cooking for his companions every night for three years, even when that meant boiling things best left unboiled. And if he could do that, then he can certainly handle a night’s shift in a kitchen with a well-supplied larder! If the PCs actually taste his cooking, they may quickly conclude that his former adventuring companions were the ones to lose him. (This is a bad hire.)

### Reynardo Greenleaf

A half-elf mage who uses various cantrips to create truly remarkable concoctions. His dishes are marvels to behold; often with their components performing intricate dances across the intricately carved plates and platters and stranger dishware they’re delivered upon. His ministrations earn the Trollskull Manor an artiste reputation, but the problem is that Reynardo “does not work to a clock.” Service is slow, and becomes a serious problem if/when the Manor’s popularity grows.
