# Introduction to Guilds

## [[Broxley Fairkettle]]

Shows up on doorstep of [[Trollskull Manor]] day after PCs arrive.

### Talking points

#### Intro

> "Welcome to the Neighborhood! I just wanted to stop by and introduce myself, I'm Broxley Fairkettle, from the Fellowship of Innkeepers, it looks as if Volo has given up on his little tavern project, are you the new owners?"

- Name is Broxley Fairkettle
- Represents Fellowship of Innkeepers
- Volo set aside project, are you new owners?

#### Need help with guilds?

> “Have you had a chance to call your local Guild reps to have them look at costs for repairs? Also if you are to run a Tavern you'll need to be a member of the Fellowship of Innkeepers, of course. I'd be happy to offer my assistance with contacting Reps to come out and bid for repairs, after your membership is paid for, obviously.”

- Have you called local guilds to get estimates?
- To run a tavern you need to be a member of the [[Fellowship Of Innkeepers]]
- Will offer assistance contacting other reps and getting bids for repairs
- Will only help once member of innkeeper guild

#### Don't want guild help?

> “I’m sure you are capable of doing the work yourselves, and there is technically no law against it, but I’d remind you that this city was built from the blood sweat and tears of the same guilds still running today, and I’m afraid if the proud waterdavians that built this city found out you weren’t putting some money back in the hands of the working class of this city, well I’d think that would leave quite a bad taste in their mouth, so much so that you might lose more than a few customers over it. I'd think. Not to mention they have specific expertise in their fields, don't want spotty work done and then have it go wrong with customers there, that's devastating for a business!”

- Waterdavians expect business owners to contribute back to the guilds
- Will lose customers if you do everything yourself instead of using guilds
- Work will be spotty if not done by guilds

#### Still not convinced? Testimony

> "Why just last summer a bakery opened up down the street, decided to do all the work himself, and ignore the wisdom of the Bakers Guild. Turns out he didn't store his flour correctly, and his entire stock was ruined by water. Such a shame. Went out of Business a week later"

- Last summer bakery opened down street, he did all the work himself
- Ignored bakers guild, ended up 'not storing his flour correctly'
- His entire stock was ruined by water, went out of business a week later

#### Cost and benefits

> "1GP a tenday or 10gp a year for membership. Also if you are brewing your own alcohol then I'd suggest you join the "Vintners', Distillers', and Brewers' Guild" Your alcohol will gain traction a lot quicker in the city, better distribution, and the members are more than happy to share secrets of the trade to make it better. If you are going to be cooking food I'd suggest you go through the Guild of Bakers to buy your bread and other cooking product, produce you can get from the open market."

- 1 GP a tenday or 10 gp a year
- Also recommend Vinter's, Distillers' and Brewers' guild to help gain traction with alchohol
- That guild will also share secrets of trade for better crafting
- For food go to Guild of Bakers for bread and cooking product
