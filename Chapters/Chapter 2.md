# General Info

## Chapter Goals

- Engage in faction missions
- Deal with [[Emmek Frewn]]
- Repair and launch [[Trollskull Manor]]

## Chapter Dynamic

- The PCs are awarded with [[Trollskull Manor]], which they can “refurnish, rebuild, rename, and otherwise personalize.”
- The expectation is that they will reopen the tavern on the first floor, and a number of encounters and mechanics are given for doing so.
- During this time, their recent notoriety also results in them being approached by one or more factions who would be interested in having them join up.
- The factions ask the PCs to perform a series of missions for them, spanning from the time the PCs are 2nd level until they are 5th level.

## Location of Stone and Eyes

### Stone of Golor

Xanthar has the stone, [[Dalakhar]] is infiltrating his base.

### Eyes

- Xanthar has one eye
- Castellanters have one eye
- Manshoon has one eye

# Chapter Flow

## Receive [[Deed-Trollskull.pdf]]

### Volo has no gold

> I confess that I have but few coins to spare. But never let it be said that Volo reneges on a promise. Allow me to present something much more valuable.” He holds out a scroll tube. “The deed to a remarkable property here in Waterdeep! We’ll need a magistrate to witness the transfer of ownership. I’ll arrange a meeting with one after you’ve inspected the estate and deemed it satisfactory.

- Volo pulls out tube containing deed to Trollskull Manor, a historic building in North Ward
- He bought the property to use as research for an upcoming book *Volo's Guide to Spirits and Specters*
- sets up meeting with tiefling magistrate named Kylynne Silmerhelve
- Deed meeting is at courthouse in Castle Ward at highsun. Collects estate tax of 25gp
- Renaer or Volo can help

### Fine Friends

Volo, Floon, [[Renaer]] all all allies now.

Volo can show around to unique places in city.

## First Time At [[Trollskull Manor]]

Three Urchins [[Urchin Overview]] are playing inside.

They are rampaging playing a fencing/tag game with swords.

### The Tale of the Troll Skull

They claim the mansion is haunetd by the ghost of a troll skull.

### During reconstruction:

**If friendly:** the urchins will help sweep up. Holler on street corners to attract customers. And so forth.
**If hostile:** they’ll break windows (20 gp each) and cause other mischief.

## The Poltergeist

### Lif

Half-elf, former bartender. Haunts the building now.

- Objects levitating or thrown
- Disappearing objects
- Knocks, rappings, footsteps
- Message written in the dust: “CLOSING TIME”, “LAST CALL”
- Physical attacks

### Appeasing

Fixing the building up to become a tavern slowly wins Lif over. (Eventually starts helping out.) If not, Lif becomes increasingly hostile.

## Guild Visits

In place of the one-time expenses found on p. 41 of Dragon Heist, the PCs will be approached by an endless array of guild representatives. Roleplay out as many of these encounters as seems entertaining. Not all of these guild services are required, and others can be negotiated.

During this time, also mix in the first visits from [[Emmek Frewn]] - [DH Info](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/trollskull-alley#BusinessRivalEmmekFrewn) as he begins plotting against the PCs.

## [[Tavern Staffing]]

The PCs will also need to hire staff: A bartender, barmaids, and cooks. How many of each will depend on how many shifts they want to remain open each day. (PCs may also be tempted to fulfill some of these roles themselves, but they’ll quickly learn that balancing a regular day job with adventuring is probably an impossible task.)

## [[Faction Overview]]

PCs should be engaged by factions through out this Chapter. Several of the first quests should be accepted and ran during this chapter.
