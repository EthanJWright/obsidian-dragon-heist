## Grand Game

The Emerald Enclave actually has no interest in the Grand Game or Neverember’s ill-gotten dragons. They’ll assist PCs who have proven loyal to the faction, but, perhaps refreshingly, will make no demands upon them for the Vault or its contents.

## Joining

Characters who seek to preserve the balance in Waterdeep.
Visited by a white cat that speaks in a melodious male voice:

## Faction Missions

| Party Level | Mission Brief | Mission Requirements and Reward |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2nd | “Outlying farms are being terrorized by a scarecrow come to life. It has slaughtered livestock, chased horses, and spooked farmers. No people have been killed as yet, so the City Guard is dragging its heels. Something must be done!” | Not one but three scarecrows are terrorizing Undercliff. One wears a sackcloth hood, another has a rotting pumpkin head, and the third is covered with a threadbare blanket. Characters who camp in a field for the better part of a day or night have a 10 percent chance of encountering one of the scarecrows. The attacks continue until all three scarecrows are destroyed. Reward: Each Emerald Enclave character gains 1 renown for ending the threat. |
| 3rd | “Sir Ambrose Everdawn, a grizzled old champion of Kelemvor, has offered to help the City Guard catch a necromancer who’s stealing bones from the City of the Dead and animating them as skeletons. Sir Ambrose could use your help, if you’re not too busy.” | Convincing Ambrose Everdawn (LG male human Tethyrian knight) that the party intends to help requires a successful DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, Sir Ambrose asks the party to patrol the southern half of the cemetery for ten consecutive nights while he patrols the north half. The characters have a cumulative 10 percent chance each night of encountering six skeletons, but there’s no sign of the necromancer who animated them. Once the skeletons are destroyed, no further encounters occur. After a tenday, Sir Ambrose releases the characters from service. Reward: Each Emerald Enclave character gains 1 renown. Each party member who patrolled the cemetery for all ten nights receives 100 gp. |
| 4th | “Doppelgangers threaten the balance of power in Waterdeep. Rumor has it a group of them are hiding in the Yawning Portal. Root them out and rid the city of them if you can.” | The characters need to confront “Bonnie” the doppelganger and, with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check, convince her to leave Waterdeep and take her gang with her. Reward: Each Emerald Enclave character gains 2 renown. |
| 5th | “The Xanathar Guild is releasing monsters to distract the City Watch and the City Guard while its members stir up trouble elsewhere. The authorities are having trouble catching and killing a flying horror known as a grell. This aberration was latest seen snatching up an old woman in the Dock Ward. Unless we intervene, she won’t be the last.” | Locating the grell requires a successful DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check followed by a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Survival) check. Each check, whether successful or not, represents 1 hour of gathering information or tracking spoor. In fact, there are two grells. One grell tries to flee if the other is killed. Reward: Each Emerald Enclave character gains 2 renown. Jeryth bestows a charm of heroism (see “Supernatural Gifts” in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide) on each party member who helped slay the grells. |
