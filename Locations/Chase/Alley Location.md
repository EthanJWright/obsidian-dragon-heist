## Description

> This cobble stones wind their way through an alley surrounded by towering buildings. Old stone and wood buildings hold balconies with open windows, the clatter of hooves echo through the alley. 


## Areas of Alley

### L1. Alley Residence

This old, one-story, windowless stone house with a slate roof is tucked in the middle of the alley, surrounded by taller buildings. Its doors are made of sturdy wood, and the outer door can be barred shut from within. Breaking down the barred door requires a successful DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check.

The interior is divided into two rooms, a kitchen with a fireplace and a plainly furnished bedroom.

### L2. Store

This stone building is a store of one kind or another. If an encounter doesnâ€™t specify the goods sold here, roll a d20 and consult the Store Goods table to determine what the store sells.

A small room serves as a cloakroom, where visitors can hang their heavier overgarments. Past the cloakroom is the store proper, with wares on display. The room to the north is a storeroom or a workshop. The store owner (commoner) has keys to all doors.
