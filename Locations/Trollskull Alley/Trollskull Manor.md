[[Trollskull Manor.png]]

## Description

> This four story tall ancient Manor boasts high balconies, a turret, and five jagged chimneys sprouting from the top. This manor seems to have once been the grandest attraction in Trollskull alley, however it has fallen into a state of disrepair. Two ravens perch on the seconf loor balcony, they look at you lazily as you approach.

- As they approach they see a mixture of shops an housing, a pretty nice neighborhood! Upper-middle class, but as they come around the corner their hopes drop a little as Trollskull Manor looms ahead.
- They arrive through the south
- There is a small deck along the front, on the right side there is a wide door, red paint peeling off, it's not boarded up

## History

- Owned by Ulkoria Stonemarrow. She sold the tavern to go adventuring.
- Sold to a family of shield dwarves. They fell on hard times and sold it to a woman named Arissa Mirthkettle.
- Mirthkettle converted the building into an orphanage. She turned out to be a hag who was cooking and eating the children.
- The building was then abandoned for several years, haunted by its horrible reputation.
- A half-elf named Lif took over the building and converted it back into a tavern.
- Lif was killed in a terrible accident 40 years ago when one of the support beams on his ale casks broke and collapsed on top of him.
- A couple named the Morleys bought the property and attempted to reopen it, but the haunting of the property combined with the economic recession which preceded Lord Dagult becoming Open Lord saw them go bankrupt.
- The property changed hands several times, but with no serious efforts to occupy it.
- A small halfling clan named the Curlbottoms bought the property around 1476 DR. They didn’t reopen the tavern, using the property exclusively as a residence for until 1484 DR when they moved to Neverwinter, caughter in Lord Dagult’s dream of rebuilding the city.
- Most recently, Emmek Frewn attempted to purchase the property at public auction, only to be outbid by Volothamp Geddarm (who was interested in researching its “haunted history” for his next book).

## Location Descriptions

### First Floor

> The first floor looks like it was a tavern, broken tables and chairs litter the floor, there is a hearth of to the left side and an L shaped bar off the back wall. Dust covers everything, it smells like mold and old beer.

- The hearth is physically in good shape, but the chimney is completely clogged, and the hearth is covered in black soot
- There is one dusty unbroken glass sitting on the bar, it breaks if it's picked up.
- One of the large windows is broken.
- All the light fixtures are broken.
- Keg of beer behind the bar, it's beyond bad, the keg rusted out
- There is some major water damage on the floor behind the bar, from the keg leaking, the floor sags as you walk on it.
- There is a small Plaque behind the bar, hanging on the wall that says "Employee of the 10 day: Lif"
- The Cellar door is completely swollen shut from the keg leak, and needs to be broken to open.
- The pantry is an absolute mess, it looks like mice/rats got into everything and feces and food is strewn all over the floor, the cabinets are in good shape still, just need some major cleaning
- The kitchen is in relatively good shape, but as you explore it you find that the hearth used to cook is completely cracked and will need repair/replacing before use.
- There is no stairs to the upper level, it looks like there use to be, but it was closed off to separate the tavern from the living quarters above at some point.

### Basement

> The cellar smells musty and strongly of vinegar.

- The Ale Cellar is empty, looks like it was cleaned out at some point, but there is an inch of standing sewage/water, and you see some broken plumbing hanging from the ceiling.
- There are 2 large wine casks in the wine cellar, but they've turned to vinegar. There is one good bottle of wine that fell from a broken wine rack that's behind one of the casks.

### Second Floor

- You have to access it by going up the external stairs in the back.
- The door is locked, you don't have the key. Maybe a neighbor notices you picking the lock, and you can introduce one of the neighbors that way.
- The common room has a couple end tables and a couch, the couch is rotten.
- Common room Fireplace is in good shape, looks like it was better taken care of, but the chimney needs cleaned out and some work done on it, there are birds nests in it.
- The Den has a nice sitting area in the turret, one of the chairs is ok, the other has a bad leg that gives out if someone sits on it. The couch is rotten completely.
- **They don't notice this, but when they get someone to take a look at the building the brickwork behind the plaster is crumbling and will need work.**
- The Bedroom has a rotten bed, as you walk in a little further you hear a noise under the bed, something jumps out at you! It's a stray cat. It jumps out the window. Stealing this part from DDAL08-00- "This old ginger tomcat has a heart of gold and likes nothing better than to snooze on your lap. He wears a name tag on his collar that identifies him as “Marmaduke”, but the tag has chipped off just underneath “This Cat Belongs To…”." But he's scared of the PCs at first and will need coaxing before he's comfortable. After that he's a permanent fixture to TrollSkull Manor, and will make himself home in the tavern, sleeping next to the fire during winter, visiting customers, etc. Maybe his owner comes after awhile and recognizes him and wants him back!
- The spare bedroom is completely empty, nothing but dust.
- The hallway has a small end table that has a worthless vase and dead flowers. There are some pictures hanging there, but they are faded and worn away.
- The Hall Is empty

### Third Floor

- The privy is nice and clean actually, it’s basically a little stool with a hole in the floor, the plumbing goes down to the cellar and is the pipe that’s broken.
- The library is in total disarray. The ceiling collapsed after a leak, and probably a heavy snow, and the 20 or so books left in the room are completely unreadable. It reeks of mold.
- The private bath has/had a large copper tub, it’s full of rust and debris and half full of water, the water ripples a little. If they investigate they find a frog and tadpoles have decided it's their new home. I'm going to really play it up and act like it's something dangerous at first. (Partially stolen from Roll20 Presents)
- The master bedroom is empty except for a large wardrobe, when you open it it’s full of dried up pine branches. (Lion, Witch and Wardrobe reference!)
- The other bedroom is really plain, and the bed in it is actually in pretty good shape, it smells of moth balls and dust. There is a painting on the wall of trollskull alley taken almost from a birds eye view.

### Attic

- One bedroom is full of junk, it looks like whenever a piece of furniture or whatever broke they put it in this room rather than throwing it away, roll on the trinket table if they search, but whatever is rolled is broken in some way. (stolen from Roll20 presents!)
- The other room has a broken window and as you open the door 2 ravens startle from their nests and fly out the window. Everything in this room is ruined.

### Turret Peak

- A single chair and an empty painting easel. One of the rooms on the 3rd floor has a worn painting from this viewpoint.

## Key Info

### Tavern Rooms

When the characters first arrive, the tavern’s taproom is filled with broken furniture, tarnished silverware, casks of wine that have turned to vinegar, and worthless detritus. The tavern’s other rooms are all empty, except for cobwebs, dust, and harmless rats.


### Spirit on Tap

The former tavern is haunted by the poltergeist (specter) of the tavern’s previous barkeeper, a half-elf named Lif. Maintaining the tavern was his life’s work, and he couldn’t abandon the place in death.

The poltergeist understands Common and Elvish, but it can’t speak. It invisibly causes mischief at the expense of the new owners by smashing plates, breaking beer barrels, and so forth. If the characters don’t take the hint, it writes not-so-subtle warnings (such as “Closing time!” and “Last call!”) on dusty floors and grimy windows. To truly claim the tavern as their own, the characters must either appease the poltergeist or destroy it.

**Appeasing Lif.** If the characters work to repair and renovate the tavern with the goal of opening it to the public again, the poltergeist begins to accept them as the new owners and gradually becomes quite accommodating: pulling out a chair when a character wants to sit down, pouring a beer and delivering it to a character, taking coats when folks come in from the rain, and so forth. Once the business is up and running, Lif can also perform other helpful functions, such as locking doors, sweeping floors, and so forth.

**Destroying Lif.** Lif’s poltergeist is destroyed if its hit points are reduced to 0. If attacked, it flees to the uppermost level of the turret when reduced to half its hit points. From there it fights to the bitter end.
