## Description

### On approach

> This four story tall ancient Manor boasts high balconies, a turret, and five jagged chimneys sprouting from the top. This manor seems to have once been the grandest attraction in Trollskull alley, however it has fallen into a state of disrepair. Two ravens perch on the second floor balcony, they look at you lazily as you approach.

### East side doors

> The double-doors on the eastern terrace of the building are heavily chained and a rusting padlock dangles from the iron handles. An old sign is mounted above the doorway, although one of the chains has come loose and it now hangs precariously. The words "Trollskull Manor" are etched into the wood.

### North side

> On the north side of the building there is a narrow set of stairs leading to the second floor doorway which is also chained and locked.

- As they approach they see a mixture of shops an housing, a pretty nice neighborhood! Upper-middle class, but as they come around the corner their hopes drop a little as Trollskull Manor looms ahead.
- They arrive through the south
- There is a small deck along the front, on the right side there is a wide door, red paint peeling off, it's not boarded up

## Location Descriptions

### First Floor

#### On entrance

> Stepping inside, the scent of pungent mildew and sour beer hits your nostrils immediately. The large taproom is furnished with several broken tables and chairs and an L-shaped bar. An old dusty hearth inhabits the north side of the room. Black ash has spilled from the hearth and small black vermin footprints are scattered around the floor.

#### Looking around

> Shattered glass and broken shelves surround the bar and behind it is a padlocked hatch to the basement and a pantry to the south. Two large metal hooks adorn the wall behind the bar, although whatever was once hung is no longer there.

- The hearth is physically in good shape, but the chimney is completely clogged, and the hearth is covered in black soot
- There is one dusty unbroken glass sitting on the bar, it breaks if it's picked up.
- One of the large windows is broken.
- All the light fixtures are broken.
- Keg of beer behind the bar, it's beyond bad, the keg rusted out
- There is some major water damage on the floor behind the bar, from the keg leaking, the floor sags as you walk on it.
- There is a small Plaque behind the bar, hanging on the wall that says "Employee of the 10 day: Lif"
- The Cellar door is completely swollen shut from the keg leak, and needs to be broken to open.

#### Pantry

> Rank smells emanate from the pantry. Broken casks and crates lean against the stone walls, with sagging shelves holding ripped sacks. Some sacks ooze and drip with the remnants of long-decayed produce. Vermin have nibbled holes in grain sacks, leaving little behind aside from floury paw prints on the shelves and ground. Beyond the pantry are broken swinging doors leading to the kitchen.

- The pantry is an absolute mess, it looks like mice/rats got into everything and feces and food is strewn all over the floor, the cabinets are in good shape still, just need some major cleaning

#### Kitchen

> The two heavy iron stoves in the kitchen remain mostly intact, aside from water damage and rust spots from a dripping broken window that has been barred with wood planks. A large, sturdy prep table in the center of the kitchen is dusty and covered in rodent droppings but otherwise standing. Cabinets once holding kitchen tools have been flung open and looted. The hearth here has a few missing bricks but a large cast iron cauldron still hangs in place. Inside the cauldron, there's a long-abandoned bird's nest.

- The kitchen is in relatively good shape, but as you explore it you find that the hearth used to cook is completely cracked and will need repair/replacing before use.
- There is no stairs to the upper level, it looks like there use to be, but it was closed off to separate the tavern from the living quarters above at some point.

### Basement

#### Ale Cellar

> The taproom's stairway descends into a dark, damp ale cellar. The smell of acrid ale and mold is almost overwhelming. Dozens of broken casks and barrels line the walls and thick cobwebs hang from the rafters. A table of brewing supplies sits around the bend in the south-east corner. The brewing supplies are dusty but usable. An inch of standing water reeks and fills the floor, you see some broken plumbing hanging from the ceiling. An unfinished doorway leads west into the wine cellar.

- The Ale Cellar is empty, looks like it was cleaned out at some point, but there is an inch of standing sewage/water, and you see some broken plumbing hanging from the ceiling.

#### Wine Cellar

> Pungent, sour smells fill this stuffy room. Oil lamps hang down the center of the domed ceiling. Large wine barrels line the south and north sides, many broken and leaking. A puddle of sludgy dark wine has formed in the center of the room.

- There are 2 large wine casks in the wine cellar, but they've turned to vinegar. There is one good bottle of wine that fell from a broken wine rack that's behind one of the casks.
- Behind one of the wine casks the [[Talking Doll]] quest item can be found
- **DM note: the bodies of 6 buried orphans can be found digging in this area**

### Second Floor

- You have to access it by going up the external stairs in the back.
- The door is locked, you don't have the key. Maybe a neighbor notices you picking the lock, and you can introduce one of the neighbors that way.

#### Common Room

> The outside staircase leads up into a large common room. A subtle scent of pipe smoke still lingers here, alluding to late nights of card-playing, drinking and gentlemen's merriment. Hooks and nails in the walls suggest that many paintings used to hang in this room. A frayed musty carpet adorns the center of the room, as well as several small broken tables and stools. Another hearth decorates the north wall, this one in relatively good shape. Intact doors leads north to a den and south to a dining hall.

- The common room has a couple end tables and a couch, the couch is rotten.
- Common room Fireplace is in good shape, looks like it was better taken care of, but the chimney needs cleaned out and some work done on it, there are birds nests in it.

#### Den

> Light floods in from the cobwebbed, barred windows in the north-east turret corner. The smell of smoke is stronger in this room, accompanied by mold. The floor is dotted with burn marks, as well as a large sagging section on the east side of the room. A drip of water hits the center of the warped wood rhythmically and comes from an equally sagging portion of ceiling.

> A doorway to the north leads out onto a long, wood-railed balcony overlooking Saerdoun Street. The railings are heavily damaged. A second doorway leads to a similar balcony facing westward overlooking the Alley.

> A door in the south-east corner leads down a long dusty hallway to a master bedroom.

- The Den has a nice sitting area in the turret, one of the chairs is ok, the other has a bad leg that gives out if someone sits on it. The couch is rotten completely.
- **They don't notice this, but when they get someone to take a look at the building the brickwork behind the plaster is crumbling and will need work.**

#### Master Bedroom

> Two stained glass windows in this bedroom hint at its former beauty. An old tarnished chandelier dangles precariously from the ceiling and a four-post bed sits in the south-east corner. The bed has been stripped of its linen and mattress and only a bare frame remains. A small hearth decorates the eastern wall. Wall sconces are mounted on either side of the hearth and a small intact dresser sits beside the bed, though one of its two empty drawers is missing. Looking out the south window into Trollskull Alley reveals a lush greenhouse with tall frosted-glass windows close by.

- The Bedroom has a rotten bed, as you walk in a little further you hear a noise under the bed, something jumps out at you! It's a stray cat. It jumps out the window. Stealing this part from DDAL08-00- "This old ginger tomcat has a heart of gold and likes nothing better than to snooze on your lap. He wears a name tag on his collar that identifies him as “Marmaduke”, but the tag has chipped off just underneath “This Cat Belongs To…”." But he's scared of the PCs at first and will need coaxing before he's comfortable. After that he's a permanent fixture to TrollSkull Manor, and will make himself home in the tavern, sleeping next to the fire during winter, visiting customers, etc. Maybe his owner comes after awhile and recognizes him and wants him back!

#### Hall

> Once a cozy dining hall with a large oak table, now stacked to the brim with various piles of junk. Broken furniture, old crates, and piles of dirty linen make moving through this room challenging. A metal-framed, wooden spiral staircase on the west wall leads to the third floor. Looking over the piles of debris, you notice a door leading south to a spare room.

- The hallway has a small end table that has a worthless vase and dead flowers. There are some pictures hanging there, but they are faded and worn away.

#### Spare Room

> Working open the stuck door reveals a spare room. The finer linens of Trollskull Manor are neatly stacked into piles here. Some are ripped and moth-eaten, but a few of the better protected sets are still in good condition. Locked double-doors lead out to a small balcony facing east with ornate, iron spiked railings. A few potted plants have been left out and are long-dead. You can get a good view of the east side of the Alley from here.

### Third Floor

- The privy is nice and clean actually, it’s basically a little stool with a hole in the floor, the plumbing goes down to the cellar and is the pipe that’s broken.

#### Upper Hall

> The spiral staircase in the Hall ascend into an Upper Hall. Unlit oil lamps and peeling wall-paper decorate the walls. A second spiral staircase to the north continues onward to a locked attic hatch. Directly ahead to the east, a doorway leads into a library. Another two narrow doors lead to small privies. Two finer, locked doors to the north-west and south-west lead to bedrooms. Finally, a south-east door leads to a larger private bath.

#### North Bedroom

> This old, musty bedroom features a small reading nook in the sun-lit turret. A sturdy ladder propped against the window can be folded open and used to access a locked hatch on the ceiling, leading to the peak of the turret.

> One of the small windows is broken and provides a well-needed breath of cool, fresh air. The shredded mattress on the bed and numerous droppings here suggests a family of rodents may live in this room. Another hearth resides on the south wall. A door on the east leads to a private bath. The bathtub's faucet is dripping and the area under the tub is sagging, wet and musty. It seems as if the heavy tub could cause the floor to collapse any second.

- The other bedroom is really plain, and the bed in it is actually in pretty good shape, it smells of moth balls and dust. There is a painting on the wall of trollskull alley taken almost from a birds eye view.

#### South Master Bedroom

> Although quite bare, this former master bedroom is in good condition. Windows are intact and the four-posted canopy bed is fairly clean aside from a scattering of vermin droppings and some cobwebs. The hearth here is well intact and a large dusty mirror hangs on the north wall. A door on the east leads into a private bath with a sink and claw-footed bathtub. The southern window provides an excellent view into the greenhouse where you notice a short elf tending to plants.

- The private bath has/had a large copper tub, it’s full of rust and debris and half full of water, the water ripples a little. If they investigate they find a frog and tadpoles have decided it's their new home. I'm going to really play it up and act like it's something dangerous at first. (Partially stolen from Roll20 Presents)

#### Library

> Two large stained-glass windows shine light into the numerous shelves in the library. Desks line the south side of this room and old quills and shreds of parchment are scattered around the room. Sadly, only a few old dusty books remain on the shelves.

### Fourth Floor

#### Staircase

> The spiral staircase leads up into a narrow, unlit hallway with two closed doors leading north and south. The floors are creaky and coated in dust.

#### Attic Bedroom

> Opening the door provokes a sudden flutter of movements and angry caws, as a family of ravens is disturbed. The three ravens quickly fly away through a hole in the roof in this former bedroom. Black feathers flutter through the now still air. The bed here has been converted into a large raven's nest, replete with all sorts of junk and trinkets like tree branches, bones, pieces of wire and wool.

- The other room has a broken window and as you open the door 2 ravens startle from their nests and fly out the window. Everything in this room is ruined.

#### Attic Storage

> The attic storage room is cluttered with dusty decor - the thick dust here is stirred into the air and catches the light as the door is opened. A stack of paintings sit precariously in the north-west corner. They mostly appear to be in fairly good condition and depict a wide variety of subject matter: from pastoral landscapes to aristocratic portraits of nobles. A few old mounted animal heads, such as elk and bears, lay protected under a white sheet. Old oil lamps and lanterns are scattered among the objects. Old musty bedrolls are propped against the eastern wall. A stained sheet covers something special in the south-west corner: the icon of the Manor, a dusty troll skull.

- One bedroom is full of junk, it looks like whenever a piece of furniture or whatever broke they put it in this room rather than throwing it away, roll on the trinket table if they search, but whatever is rolled is broken in some way. (stolen from Roll20 presents!)

### Turret Peak

> Climbing through the hatch reveals the small, dimly lit turret peak. A dusty oil lantern dangles from the conical roof. A small window provides the highest westward view from the Manor, overlooking the Alley. A single chair with an empty painting easel sits next to the window. A dozen finely made silk pillows are tossed haphazardly in the corner - searching underneath them reveals a handful of hidden rough sketches, mostly nudes.

- A single chair and an empty painting easel. One of the rooms on the 3rd floor has a worn painting from this viewpoint.

## Key Info

### Spirit on Tap

The former tavern is haunted by the poltergeist (specter) of the tavern’s previous barkeeper, a half-elf named Lif. Maintaining the tavern was his life’s work, and he couldn’t abandon the place in death.

The poltergeist understands Common and Elvish, but it can’t speak. It invisibly causes mischief at the expense of the new owners by smashing plates, breaking beer barrels, and so forth. If the characters don’t take the hint, it writes not-so-subtle warnings (such as “Closing time!” and “Last call!”) on dusty floors and grimy windows. To truly claim the tavern as their own, the characters must either appease the poltergeist or destroy it.

**Appeasing Lif.** If the characters work to repair and renovate the tavern with the goal of opening it to the public again, the poltergeist begins to accept them as the new owners and gradually becomes quite accommodating: pulling out a chair when a character wants to sit down, pouring a beer and delivering it to a character, taking coats when folks come in from the rain, and so forth. Once the business is up and running, Lif can also perform other helpful functions, such as locking doors, sweeping floors, and so forth.

**Destroying Lif.** Lif’s poltergeist is destroyed if its hit points are reduced to 0. If attacked, it flees to the uppermost level of the turret when reduced to half its hit points. From there it fights to the bitter end.
