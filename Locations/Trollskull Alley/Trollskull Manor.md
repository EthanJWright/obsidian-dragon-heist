## Description

> This four story tall ancient Manor boasts high balconies, a turret, and five jagged chimneys sprouting from the top.

## History

- Owned by Ulkoria Stonemarrow. She sold the tavern to go adventuring.
- Sold to a family of shield dwarves. They fell on hard times and sold it to a woman named Arissa Mirthkettle.
- Mirthkettle converted the building into an orphanage. She turned out to be a hag who was cooking and eating the children.
- The building was then abandoned for several years, haunted by its horrible reputation.
- A half-elf named Lif took over the building and converted it back into a tavern.
- Lif was killed in a terrible accident 40 years ago when one of the support beams on his ale casks broke and collapsed on top of him.
- A couple named the Morleys bought the property and attempted to reopen it, but the haunting of the property combined with the economic recession which preceded Lord Dagult becoming Open Lord saw them go bankrupt.
- The property changed hands several times, but with no serious efforts to occupy it.
- A small halfling clan named the Curlbottoms bought the property around 1476 DR. They didn’t reopen the tavern, using the property exclusively as a residence for until 1484 DR when they moved to Neverwinter, caughter in Lord Dagult’s dream of rebuilding the city.
- Most recently, Emmek Frewn attempted to purchase the property at public auction, only to be outbid by Volothamp Geddarm (who was interested in researching its “haunted history” for his next book).

## Key Info

### Tavern Rooms

When the characters first arrive, the tavern’s taproom is filled with broken furniture, tarnished silverware, casks of wine that have turned to vinegar, and worthless detritus. The tavern’s other rooms are all empty, except for cobwebs, dust, and harmless rats.

### Spirit on Tap

The former tavern is haunted by the poltergeist (specter) of the tavern’s previous barkeeper, a half-elf named Lif. Maintaining the tavern was his life’s work, and he couldn’t abandon the place in death.

The poltergeist understands Common and Elvish, but it can’t speak. It invisibly causes mischief at the expense of the new owners by smashing plates, breaking beer barrels, and so forth. If the characters don’t take the hint, it writes not-so-subtle warnings (such as “Closing time!” and “Last call!”) on dusty floors and grimy windows. To truly claim the tavern as their own, the characters must either appease the poltergeist or destroy it.

**Appeasing Lif.** If the characters work to repair and renovate the tavern with the goal of opening it to the public again, the poltergeist begins to accept them as the new owners and gradually becomes quite accommodating: pulling out a chair when a character wants to sit down, pouring a beer and delivering it to a character, taking coats when folks come in from the rain, and so forth. Once the business is up and running, Lif can also perform other helpful functions, such as locking doors, sweeping floors, and so forth.

**Destroying Lif.** Lif’s poltergeist is destroyed if its hit points are reduced to 0. If attacked, it flees to the uppermost level of the turret when reduced to half its hit points. From there it fights to the bitter end.
