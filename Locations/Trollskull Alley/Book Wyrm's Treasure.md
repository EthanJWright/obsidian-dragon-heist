## Description

### Outside

> The front of this three story wooden building is adorned with a charming sign of a gold dragon curled around a treasure hoard of books and scrolls.

### Inside

> The door to the shop doesn't open completely as it bangs into a shelf spilling with books. Beautiful hardwood shelves fills all space in this shop. The earthy scent of old books permeates the air. You can hear movement and shuffling from the back end of the shop, but so many shelves fill the room that you have to weave your way through to navigate to the back.

## Key Info

- First two floors are library, 3rd / top floor is where Rishaal lives
-  books of all sorts can be found here ( if players ever research )
- Rishall has spell books for sale (see below) -- he can scribe as a spell scroll, but that costs double.
