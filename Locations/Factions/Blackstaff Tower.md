## Name

Blackstaff Tower

## Location

Castle Ward, Swords street

## Description

### On Approach

> In the distance you see a squat black blot in the otherwise pretty ward. Humble though the edifice might be, looking at the place for too long starts to give you a queasy feeling, you even feel as though you may be currently watched.

### Exterior

> The tower appears to be made out of smooth black stone, with no windows or doors. Looking upon the tower, it appears to be a modest three stories in height. A 20 foot wall of metal woven rose bushes wraps it's way around the outer gardens.

### Interior

> You can see windows covering the walls, showing the busy waterdeep streets, and birds flitting about the outer garden. A great open space contains stairwells that shift and twist into the sky, leading to floating arches that hang in the air.

### Fortifications

Apprentices can gain access through a small apprentice gate by touching the gate with a left palm. The tower will attack and ward off anyone who attempts to enter it's magical walls uninvited.
