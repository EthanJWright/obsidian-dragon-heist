## Name

Phaulkonmere

## Location

South of Kolat Towers

## Description

### Outer description

> This is by far one of the grandest and best-kept buildings in the South ward. This walled villa seems very much out of place among the warehouses and tradeshops in the area. The two-story manor house is lavishly decorated with pillars, polished stone, and gilded falcons alighting from each corner of its small high tower. Windows are also plentiful, allowing much light and air into the luxurious house.

### Fortifications

The manor house has magical protections provided by the Watchful Order of Magists & Protectors (only Lord Phaulkon and the mages involved know what such wards are, and they are changed monthly).
 

> All around the top of the manor wall are golden metal barbed spikes to protect the gardens. Shimmering lights can sometimes be seen glinting in the air around the manor.

## History

Owned by the Tarm and Phaulkon noble families.
Four warehouses once stood where Phaulkonmere is now, but these were destroyed in the Wardfires of 1358 DR (326 NR the land was purchased by an up-and-coming merchant, well-to-do caravan organizer, and minor noble from Cormyr. Lord Bronson Phaulkon took the land and built his wife and family a manor amongst those people who support us, not amongst those who wish to associate with us due only to our income.‚Äù The manor and its high-walled gardens were finished by winter of the next year. Phaulkonmere is two buildings within a walled enclosure.
