## Info

Use the description of the Autumn version of the theater from the original campaign. Jarlaxle owns this theater under the false identity of Rongquan Mystere. One of the dressing rooms is kept empty as a safe house for D’Aerthe agents in trouble. Jarlaxle will also use the theater as a “neutral” meeting place with other factions (including the PCs).

## Clues

### Malcolm Brizzenbright

Ghost from [Winter Theater ](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/dragon-season#TheaterWinter)

- He knows that “Rongquan Mystere” is a fake identity, and he’s anxious that his theater not be used for nefarious purposes.
- He can identify the dressing room being used as a safe house.
- He once saw “Rongquan” speaking with drow in the lobby during a performance of The Mad Mage’s Seven Riddles. They mentioned something called the “Sea Maidens Faire”.

Amongst the other papers dealing with theater work is a Letter Regarding Fenerus Stormcastle’s House. 

> J, There have been strange eyes fixed upon the house of Fenerus Stormcastle and flights of black snakes have been seen flocking the skies of the Trades Ward. Greater care should be taken when messengers approach the house, and we may want to find an alternative asset. I leave it to your judgment whether or not Fenerus himself should be warned. -K
