## Location

Trade Ward, Quill Alley - Dragon Heist p. 63

## Info

 [[Fenerus Stormcastle]] lives here.

Since the Sea Maidens Faire arrived in Waterdeep, Fenerus has also been acting as a message drop for Bregan D’Aerthe. Fenerus collects messages from various covert drops and brings them back to his house, where they are collected by Krebbyg Masq’il’yr and taken back to Jarlaxle’s ship.

## Clues

### Questioning Fenerus

 Although he’s supposed to be a cut-out, Fenerus once followed [[Krebbyg]] after Jarlaxle’s lieutenant picked up the messages and knows that they’re being taken to the Sea Maidens Faire.

### Following [[Krebbyg]]

[[Krebbyg]] comes to collect messages from Fenerus once every 1d3 days. If the PCs stake out the house long enough, they may also be able to follow him to the Sea Maidens Faire.
