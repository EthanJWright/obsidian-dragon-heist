Trade Ward, Quill Alley - [Dragon Heist](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/dragon-season#Encounter1Alley) p. 63, [[Alley Location]]

## Info

 [[Fenerus Stormcastle]] lives here.

Since the Sea Maidens Faire arrived in Waterdeep, Fenerus has also been acting as a message drop for Bregan D’Aerthe. Fenerus collects messages from various covert drops and brings them back to his house, where they are collected by Krebbyg Masq’il’yr and taken back to Jarlaxle’s ship.

## Clues

### Questioning Fenerus

 Although he’s supposed to be a cut-out, Fenerus once followed [[Krebbyg]] after Jarlaxle’s lieutenant picked up the messages and knows that they’re being taken to the Sea Maidens Faire.

### Following [[Krebbyg]]

[[Krebbyg]] comes to collect messages from Fenerus once every 1d3 days. If the PCs stake out the house long enough, they may also be able to follow him to the Sea Maidens Faire.

### Messages

The PCs may be able to capture several messages. These are written in code, requiring an Intelligence test (DC 16) to decipher. (The check is made with advantage if they speak Drow.) The contents of these messages will vary depending on when, exactly, the PCs come to Fenerus’ house. Possibilities include:

> Information unrelated to the Grand Game, most likely revolving around attempting to identify Masked Lords, gain blackmail material over them, and/or diplomatic assessments of their support for Luskan joining the Lords’ Alliance.

> A report from the Gralhund Villa observation team: “Watchpost established in the manor south of the Gralhund Villa. We have identified members of the Black Network onsite. We have also observed gazers in the area, although we have not yet determined which beholders’ dark dreams they’ve sprung out of. – Fel’Rekt Lafeen”

> “Westra Moltimmur is demanding three additional dresses for Sapphiria’s Booty. Considerable expense. Rongquan Mystere may need to put in an appearance.” (A little research can quickly identify these names as referring to the Seven Masks Theater, see below.)

> “The Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, & Choristers refuses to withdraw their objection to the Sea Maidens Faire as a public entertainment. But I’ve resolved the matter by getting license from the Jesters’ Guild. We only need to make payment to them with claim that we are employing a guild entertainer, even though we’re not. The guilds in this city are even more rotten than those in Luskan.”

> “Nimblewright delivery completed to Bowgentra Summertaen. We have eyes up in the Watchful Order.” (Summertaen is the leader of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors, a guild for wizards and sorcerers in Waterdeep.)
