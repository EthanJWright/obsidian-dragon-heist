## General Structure

All lieutenants carry pass-amulets to Kolat Towers, but will attempt to destroy them if it looks as if they are being captured. (Argorn, a feckless weasel, will attempt to barter it for his own life). If they're slain by the PCs, Sidra will give them to Kaevra.

- 1 lieutenant ([[Vevette Blackwater]], [[Urstul Floxin]], [[Agorn Fuoco]])
- 3-4 **thugs (cr1/2)**

### Clues

#### To the interrogation house

Any Zhentarim response team will have been instructed to take them as prisoners to the Zhentarim Interrogation House. If questioned, they’ll be able to point the PCs in the direction of the house in Brindul Alley in the Trade Ward.

### Notes

Note that the Zhentarim response teams are generally weaker than the response teams from the other factions. This probably means the Zhents won’t be taken as seriously by the PCs as the other factions, but it also makes them a good selection if you want to or need to hit the PCs when they’re already weakened.
