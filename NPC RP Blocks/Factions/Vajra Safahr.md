- Grew up in Sheshyr House in Tethyr with several older siblings.

- In 1479 DR, Samarck was assassinated by Khondar and Centiv Naomal. Vajra became the Blackstaff’s heir, but was not yet fully prepared to assume the Blackstaff’ mantle and was captured by Khondar.
- Vajra was rescued by Renaer Neverember, Laraelra Harsard, and their friends, who also helped her reach Blackstaff Tower so that she could fully integrate the personalities of the former Blackstaffs. (See Blackstaff’s Tower for details.)
