> A handsome man with black hair, a streak of silver hangs foppishly over his brow. He wears a sharp suite and smokes a slim black pipe.

## Roleplaying

- Speaks concisely.
- Arches an eyebrow inquisitively.
- Puffs on his pipe thoughtfully.

## Background

- Private eye who runs the Tiger’s Eye, located towards the western end of Trollskull Alley (DH p. 32).
- Actually a rakshasa named Valantajar; uses disguise self before speaking to visitors or emerging into public (DC 18 on Intelligence (Investigation) check to detect). The spells lasts for 1 hour, so he notably excuses himself at such intervals.
- Investigations: 50 gp sufficient for most investigations, but if it’s a significant task (investigating major factions, for example), Trench might require a service in payment, such as slaying enemies that are hunting it, posting advertisements for its business in their tavern, or keeping tabs on someone he’s been hired to spy on.
