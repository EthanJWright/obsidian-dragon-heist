## Extra Info

### Branderthall

Four-story residence in the Sea Ward. Formerly Neverember Manor, but Renaer restored its original name in his mother’s honor.

- Friends have an open invitation to use the house as they please.
- Madrak: White-haired halfling butler. Knew Renaer’s mother; promised her to keep an eye on Renaer. Madrak’s son Bramal and his children oversee the Brandath estates.
- Gate to Varadras: Turning a stone rosebud outside the garderobe at the hallway past Renaer’s office causes the garderobe to drop out of sight and a stone staircase to rotate down from the ceiling. Shoving a metal bench over the top of the stairwell causes it to reset from the top. The stairs lead to a hidden rooftop rose garden, where there is statue of a kneeling elf maid; for as long as water is poured into the statue’s hands, a portal opens to Varadras.

### Varadras

Built by Renaer’s ancestor Varad Brandath. About 100 miles due west of Beliard, near the Stone Bridge northwest of Waterdeep. Various passwords (“Kamatar,” “Palnethar,” “Dorneathr”) cause hearths and torches to flare to light.

- Varad was one of the last students of Khelben “Blackstaff” Arunsun, and later friends with him and also Pikar Salibuck (Madrak’s father, Osco’s great-grandfather).
- See Chapter 9 of Blackstaff Tower for additional details.

### Black Tears

Founded shortly after Vajra became Blackstaff, the Black Tears were meant to “follow in the Blackstaff’s wake” just as the Tears of Selune follow in the wake of the moon.

- Members: Lord Torlyn Wands, Osco Salibuck, Eiruk Weskur, Harug Shieldsunder, Laraelra Harsard, Meloon Wardragon, Parlek Lateriff, and Renaer.
- Roarke House: Meeting place of the Black Tears, in honor of the memory of Vharem Kuthcutter and Faxhal Xoram, friends of the Black Tears’ who fell in battle defending Vajra and the city. They are interred in sarcophagi bearing the crescent moon and star in catacombs beneath Roarke House, near the location where Faxhal died. Roarke House is decorated heavily with moons and star, as Volam Roarke was a devout worshiper of Selune (he also financed the restoration of the House of the Moon after the Spellplague). The Roarkes lost their fortune and the Brandaths acquired their properties around 1440 DR. Renaer also owns a neighboring warehouse and the Gildenfires festhall on the opposite side of the warehouse.
- Rook’s Hold: The Rook was a thief of some repute in the 14th Roarke House connects to his hideout, which was located in the subterranean crypts after which Skulls Street was named. The Black Tears have resecured it.
