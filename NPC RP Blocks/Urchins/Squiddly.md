**Languages:** Nat’s sign language, common, infernal

**Darkvision:** up to 60 ft.

**Hellish resistance:** resistance to fire damage.

**Strong tail:** Squiddly has put a lot of work into learning fine control of his tail. He may use it as a third hand for simple tasks and to assist himself in climbing an object, he has advantage on any athletics checks when climbing. In combat he may use a bonus action to make an attack with it. This attack has a +2 to hit and does 1d4 bludgeoning damage.

**Rambunctious:** Sometimes Squiddly can’t control himself and he’ll act out in a manner inappropriate for the situation. The DM may have Squiddly roll a d100 at any time, on a 1-20 his hyper energy gets the better of him and who knows what might happen.
