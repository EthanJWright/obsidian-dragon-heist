## Alexandrian Response Team

It may be odd to think of the Three Urchins as a “response team”, but they are a proactive node that the GM can bring onscreen as desired. A few things I’d consider:

### Fun Implementations

- Introduce the Urchins in Trollskull Alley, possibly even as part of the first scene where the PCs arrive at Trollskull Mansion. (They might be inside the abandoned building, rampaging around, pretending to fight trolls and such, and offering all kinds of stories about the ghost of a troll skull which haunts the building.)
- Have them follow the PCs. They “fancy themselves as adventurers of sorts, and they are quick to idolize and emulate real-life ones.”
- Have them interfere with faction missions (most likely while trying to help, unless the PCs have pissed them off).
- Let them be valuable sources of information. They can show up in the streets around Gralhund Villa, familiar with the neighborhood. Nat might know [[Agorn Fuoco]] because she grew up in the same neighborhood he lived in (and knows that he murdered his mother). And so forth.
- Have them eavesdrop on the PCs and volunteer to help.
- Utilize the [Autumn Alley](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/dragon-season#AlleyAutumn) Encounter

### Dark Implementations

- If the bad guys are looking for someone to kidnap in order to gain leverage over the PCs, one or more of the Urchins makes a great target. (Going to rescue them and discovering that they’ve already broken out of their cell and are causing huge headaches for the bad guys by sneaking around the outpost or lair where they’re being held also offers great comedic opportunities.)
- As I will discuss at further length in Part 5, I think it necessary to give the PCs a stronger motivation to investigate the fireball that kills Dalakhar beyond “it happened sort of near us and it’s obviously a plot hook, so we should just go for it.” One way to provide that motivation is to kill someone the PCs care about as collateral damage. If it won’t be a deal-breaker for your group, I guarantee that killing one of the Urchins after the PCs have become friends with them will set them permanently on the warpath no matter how many city officials tell them to back off.

## Group Stats

**Ignored:** The group has become accustomed to moving through crowded streets and generally being ignored by adults around them. All three of them always have advantage on stealth rolls, nothing can negate this ability.

**Sticky fingers:** The three of them are a well oiled machine when it comes to picking pockets and swiping food and supplies from vendor stalls. When one of the kids performs a sleight of hand check attempting to steal small items each other kid available to help may roll 1d4 to add to the check. These bonuses are only available once per victim per day as their shtick becomes suspicious after too long.

**Simple diet:** The three of them have adapted to living on a very simple raw diet of bread, fruit, vegetables, and the occasional cured meat. Their bodies respond quickly to the energy pick me up provided by these simple foods and they recover 1d4+1 HP when consumed.
