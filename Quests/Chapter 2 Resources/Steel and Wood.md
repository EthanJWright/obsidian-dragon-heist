# Steel and Wood

## Start

Talking with the Genasi. The quest starts when the party either visits [[Steam and Steel]] or [[Embric ]]and [[Avi]] visit the party at [[Trollskull Manor]] to welcome them to the neighborhood. As the genasi couple speak with the party, Avi eventually leads the conversation to [[Tally Fellbranch]], the half-elf owner of [[The Bent Nail]]. 

 > "Have you met Tally yet? The owner of the Bent Nail?" the blue skinned water genasi asks. Before you can answer, Embric rolls his eyes and says: "By Kossus' flame, why can't you just let it go?". Avi sends a teasing glare his partner's way. "Don't flare up now, darling. I'm just making conversation with our new friends." He turns back to you. "I'm just wondering what your impression is of him. We've been trying to get into business with him, but it seems..." Once again, Embric interjects: "He doesn't like that we're together. Fine. We've faced ignorance before. It's nothing new - I won't waste any more of my time speaking of it!" Embric storms off after this. After he's left, Avi explains that

- [[Embric]] storms off
- [[Avi]] explains the following
    - invited [[Tally Fellbranch]] over for dinner to discuss business
    - proposition was to venture to craft wood and metal items to sell
    - dinner started well, but as night progressed Tally got uncomfortable at the displays of affection between the two genasi
    - Tally flatly rejected offer and left before finishing exquisite Calishite chocolate-cake [[Embric]] made
    - Tally has been cold and dismissive ever since
    - Embric says he doesn't care, Avi knows his feelings are hurt
    - Avi isn't sure Tally is a bigot, wants party to help him find out what is going on
- If party accepts, Avi offers 20% discount at Steam and Steel

### Talking with Tally

- [[Tally Fellbranch]] can be found in his shop [[The Bent Nail]]
- he is friendly, whittling wooden cane
- wont open up without a DC 10 Charisma (persuasion) check

> Tally puts down the cane he's working on and sighs heavily. "I know they think it's because I don't like them being together, but it's not that... Or, well, in a way it is. You see, I used to be married. Her name was Isolla. The most brilliant and beautiful woman I've ever met. But she was human. We had many great years together, but while I just greyed a bit at the temples, she grew old and eventually... It's been several years now, and I thought I had moved on. But, seeing the two of them together, so happy and so perfect for each other, just hurts too much. If we went into business together, I'd have to see that everyday. I can't bear that. But how do you explain to someone that you can't be around them, because they're too happy? That's not fair either."

## Resolution

- Getting an explanation fulfils quest

### Temple of Sune Widower Sermon

- Character with proficiency in religion can remember the Temple of Sune, the goddess of beauty and love, regularly holds sermons where widowers can meet, mourn, and mingle, often resulting in new, beautiful unions. 
- Avi can come up with the idea after being told of Tally's response
- With a little persuasion, Tally will attend
- If this path is taken, Avi and Embric show up at the Manor with a smiling Tally and an elven woman a few weeks later - just to give thanks to the party before heading out for a couples' dinner!
