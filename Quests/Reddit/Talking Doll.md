A creepy minor event to flesh out Trollskull Manor

## Info

This cast off toy is found at the very back of the cellar, underneath a heavy barrel. It is tattered and dirty, and clearly quite old, but there is evidence it was once well-loved, and had been repaired many times.

The doll belonged to one of the orphans taken in by the hag who lived in Trollskull long ago. It acts similarly to a Talking Doll (XGE) except it cannot be re-programmed. The shared trauma of the Hag's victims has imbued the doll with a small amount of magic.

## The Dolls History

The players can learn the [[Trollskull Manor History]], and it's past as a Hag Den, through a few sources.

Ulkoria Stonemarrow knows the history of the manor (as she used to own it, see "Open for Business" in Chapter 2), and will explain it if asked or if she witnesses the doll speaking. She'll say she didn't find out it was a Hag until some time after the Orphanage closed (it is up to the DM if the hag was killed or escaped).

The city records office records an Orphanage being opened in the same spot as Trollskull manor, which operated for 3 years before closing. It has no records of a business presence after that for some time (up to the DM if there was anything there before Lif's bar).

Any of the older adventurers in Force Grey, the Harpers, the City Watch, or the Order of the Gauntlet can also remember there being talk of a Hag Den in the North Ward around that time.

The Hag may have also worked with The Xanathar (though it was a different Beholder at the time), but none of the current members are likely to remember this.

## Dealing with the doll

If destroyed (burned, thrown out, etc) the doll reappears somewhere in the manor the next morning. A Dispel Magic will suppress all magical effects of the doll for 2d4 days, after which it will re-appear (if removed/destroyed) and continue speaking as normal. An exorcism or banishment from a priest/cleric will fail, with the priest saying (of a PC realizing) something like "Well, it's not a ghost or spirit. I don't think it's malevolent, and the doll is a symptom of something else, not a cause. If you can find what is causing this haunting, we may be able to resolve it"

Lif will intentionally avoid being near the doll. It's magical aura is unpleasant to other spirits.

The doll can be quieted permanently by exhuming the children's bones that were buried (either in the basement, or behind the manor) and either destroying them, or giving them a proper burial or service in the City of the Dead. Kelemvor's church (along with the Gravedigger's Guild) will do this for a small fee. The doll becomes a non-magical trinket once the bones are dealt with.

Searching for and exhuming the bones is not especially difficult if the players are intentionally looking for them, but could take a couple days to do. Alternatively, the bones may be found/exhumed during renovations of the masonry.
